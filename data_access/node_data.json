to Karta.

I wanted a better way to organise my files and my notes flexibly, a way that meshed together with how I think and want to work, by making new associations between individual pieces of information and having them appear dynamically whenever they are relevant. Karta is my first serious attempt at this.\n\nThis is a super early prototype of the idea, as barebones as can be. As such, many features you would expect from a software like this are still missing. Things such as selecting multiple nodes, undoing and redoing, search, and God knows what else. They are definitely planned, but I think the current version is already enough for basic mindmapping and playing around with the core idea of Focal Nodes. \n\nFeedback and suggestions are absolutely welcome.

The only nodes visible will be the ones connected with Wires to the Focal Node. Changing the Focal Node to be a different node will despawn all nodes not connected to the new Focal and spawn all missing connections. \n\nHere's the cool part: every Node stores the relative positions of its connections and has control over their positions when set as the Focal. When you move a node, you are moving its relative position to the current Focal Node, but not anywhere else. Absolute positions are limiting, and therefore don't exist.\n\n\nCONTROLS:\nThe button on the top-left corner of each Node is the Focal Panel. Double Click it on a Node to set it as the new Focal.
